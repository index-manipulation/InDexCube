# Repository content
This repository contains all the needed file to build, modify and use in simulation the InDex Cube. The dimensions of the first InDex cube are 5x5x5 cm.

## Cube Faces
Contains PNG and PDF files for the texture of each cube face. These files are useful to print stickers to attach to a 3D printed version of the cube. We recommend to print the sticker using a matte material.

## Cube Model
Contains:

* *InDexCube.blend* and *InDexCube.blend1* -- The Blender project files. Can be used to modify the cube.
* *IndexCubeTexture.png* -- Texture applied on the cube.
* *InDexCube.mtl* -- The material settings file needed to correctly apply the texture on the cube.
* *InDexCube.obj* -- 3D Image of the Index Cube. To properly work it references *InDexCubeTexture.png* and *InDexCube.mtl*.
